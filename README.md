# Explainable AI
1. [InterpretML](https://interpret.ml/) - Open source Python framework that combines local and global explanation methods, 
as well as, transparent models, like decision trees, rule based models, and GAMs (Generalized Additive Models), into
a common API and dashboard.
2. [AI Explainability 360](http://aix360.mybluemix.net/) - Open source Python XAI framework devloped by IBM researchers 
combining different data, local and global explanation methods. Also see there [github page](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIX360).
3. [explainX.ai](https://github.com/explainX/explainx) - Open source Python framework that launches an 
interactive dashboard for a model in a single line of code in which a model can be investigated using 
different XAI methods.
4. [Alibi Explain](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi) - Open source Pyton XAI framework combining different methods. 
Main focus on counterfactual explanations and SHAP for classification tasks on tabular data or images.
5. [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) - THe open source Python framework for generating SHAP explanations. Focused
on tree based models, but contains the model agnostic KernelSHAP and an implementation for deep neural networks.
6. [Lucid](https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid) - Open source Python framework to explain deep convolutional 
neural networks used on image data (currently only supports Tensforflow 1). Focuses on understanding the 
representations the network has learned.
7. [DeepLIFT](https://github.com/kundajelab/deeplift) - Open source implementation of the DeepLIFT methods for generating
local feature attributions for deep neural networks.
8. [iNNvestigate](https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate) - Github repository collecting implementations of different
feature attribution and gradient based explanation methods for deep neural networks.
9. [Skope-rules](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skope-rules) - Open source Python framework for building rule
based models.
10. [Yellowbrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/) - Open source Python framework to create different visualizations
of data and ML models. 
11. [Captum](https://captum.ai/) - Open source framework to explain deep learning models created with PyTorch. Includes
many known XAI algorithms for deep neural networks.
12. [What-If Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/) - Open source frmaework from Google to probe the behaviour
of a trained model.
